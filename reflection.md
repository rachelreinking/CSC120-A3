I attended TA hours on Wednesday 2/15

Working in Java is definitely more specific than working in Python. For example, at first, I was getting a lot of errors because I wasn't specifying the type of each variable and I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong because that isn't a requirement in Python. However, each language had basic fundamentals that are the same, such as loops and defining functions, and once I began to understand the syntax of how to implement these in Java as I practiced, I was able to connect Java back to the programming fundamentals that I have already learned and I was able to make real progress.

Based on the differences between Python and Java, I can understand that there are many approaches to programming and many correct ways to solve one problem. Python and Java are written pretty differently, and I imagine that the flexibility of Python would be better suited for some programmers and problems, while the rigidity of Java would be better suited for other programmers and problems.

I found it very helpful to fill out ConversationIntro.java from A3-warmup, because it got me used to writing in Java and solving some of the types of problems that were present in this assignment. I repurposed some of the code that I wrote in ConversationIntro.java when working on Conversation.java. I also found it helpful to consult the Java documentation, because it allowed me to search for functions that could solve problems I was working on, showed the exact parameters and syntax of functions, and also just overall helped me to understand the logic of writing Java better.
